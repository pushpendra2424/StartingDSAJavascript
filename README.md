# Time Complexcity
Time complexity is defined as the amount of time taken by an algorithm to run, as a function of the length of the input.

# What is big O time complexity?
The Big O Notation for time complexity gives a rough idea of how long it will take an algorithm to execute based on two things: the size of the input it has and the amount of steps it takes to complete. We compare the two to get our runtime.
# Which time complexity is best?
Big O(1) has the least complexity. Often called “constant time”, if you can create an algorithm to solve the problem in O(1), you are probably at your best.

# What is space complexity with example?
Space complexity refers to the total amount of memory space used by an algorithm/program, including the space of input values for execution. Calculate the space occupied by variables in an algorithm/program to determine space complexity. However, people frequently confuse Space-complexity with auxiliary space.

# What is extra space complexity ?
Auxiliary Space is the extra space or temporary space used by an algorithm. Space Complexity of an algorithm is the total space taken by the algorithm with respect to the input size. Space complexity includes both Auxiliary space and space used by input.
